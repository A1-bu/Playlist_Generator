      When opening the folder please make sure the CSV file �Billboardtop100.csv� is attached because this is where the data is coming from. 
      From there run the program �Playlist_gen.py� and enter 3 genres from: Rap, Pop, Country, Classic, Latin, Alternative. 
      It does not matter if the genre is capitalized because the program accounts for this. 
      If there valid genres are entered you will receive a 10 song playlist. Enjoy!
